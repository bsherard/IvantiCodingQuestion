<p>This is a single-page angular front end web application bundled with an ASP Web API service. It provides the two following functions queried and displayed by the client application and calculated and returned by the service:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1.A</strong> - Calculate the coordinates([X1,Y1], [X2,Y2], [X3,Y3]) of a triangle given a Row(A-F) and Column(1-12).</li>
  <li><strong>1.B</strong> - Calculate the Row(A-F) and Column(1-12) of a triangle given a coordinates([X1,Y1], [X2,Y2], [X3,Y3]).</li>
</ul>
<p>The triangles in question are generated using the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each triangle is a right angle triangle with length and height of 10 pixels.</li>
  <li>Using a 60 by 60 pixel grid starting at [0,0] at the top left, arrange triangles in pairs to create squares of 10 by 10 in size, filling the entire grid.</li>
  <li>Each triangle pair has a hypotenus between its top left vertex and its bottom right vertex.</li>
  <li>The magnitude of the vector formed by any two sides of a triangle is 10; because the triangles are discrete pixel positions and not continuous, the length is found by finding the difference between the verticies of a side and then adding 1. So a triangle with a Vertex [0,0] might have a side of length ten with the Vertex [0,9].</li>
  <li>The Row of a triangle is determined by the vertical(Y) component of its verticies, starting at A for verticies between 0 and 9.</li>
  <li>The Column of a triangle is determined by the horizontal(X) component of its verticies, starting at 1 and 2 for its first triangle pair for verticies between 0 and 9. The bottom left triangle takes the lower Column value and the top right triangle takes the next value.</li>
  <li>Vertex ordering of a Triangle's coordinates is irrelevant. A coordinate of V1=[X1,Y1], V2=[X2,Y2], V3=[X3,Y3] is functionally equal to V2=[X1,Y1], V3=[X2,Y2], V1=[X3,Y3].</li>
</ul>
